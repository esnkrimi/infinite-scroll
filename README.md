# Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

Is infinite scroll that fetch data from json file and show it 5 record by record that it change page number automatically each 2 seconds.

I used NHGRX to store fetched data from api(JSON).

I used media detect screen to solve reponive challenges(Text will hide for device with width lower than 800px)
